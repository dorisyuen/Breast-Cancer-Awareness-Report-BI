## The dataset contains some information by breast cancer patient including :
1. Age > Age of patient
2. Gender > Female / Male
3. Protein1, Protein2, Protein3, Protein4 > Expression levels of four proteins
4. Tumor Stage > Breast cancer stage of the patient
5. Histology > Type of cancer: Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma / Infiltration Lobular Carcinoma / Mucinous Carcinoma
6. ER > Estrogen Receptors - Positive / Negative
7. PR > Progesterone Receptors - Positive / Negative
8. HER2 status > Positive / Negative
9. Surgery type > Simple Mastectomy / Modified Radical Mastectomy / Lumpectomy / Other
10. Date of Surgery > Date of patient start surgery
11. Date of Last Visit >  Date of last visit / follow-up
12. Patient Status >  Alive / Dead
### The dataset obtained from the following link: http://biogps.org/dataset/tag/brca1/
This information can be utilized to analyze the correlation between protein expression levels, cancer stage, and patient outcomes, as well as to gain insights into the impact of different surgical procedures on patient survival and identify potential risk factors for breast cancer progression. 

In my analysis, I focused on examining the relationship between protein expression levels and their variations across different age groups. I observed that protein 2 consistently showed higher expression levels compared to the other three types of proteins, regardless of age. However, it was noteworthy that protein 2 exhibited a significant decrease in expression as patients aged. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring protein expression levels in individuals as they grow older.

Furthermore, I discovered that stage 2 tumors were more prevalent compared to other stages across all three types of cancer. This indicates the need for increased attention and intervention at stage 2 to improve patient outcomes.

Lastly, I observed that patients with a negative Her2 status had a higher survival rate compared to those with a positive status. This finding suggests that the absence of Her2 expression may be associated with better prognosis.

Overall, these findings emphasize the significance of monitoring protein expression levels, identifying tumor stage, and considering Her2 status in assessing breast cancer prognosis and developing appropriate interventions for improved patient outcomes.
